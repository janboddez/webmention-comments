# Webmention Comments
Basic Webmention support for WordPress.

Turns incoming webmentions into comments. All webmentions undergo basic validation and are then dumped into a database table. The content of that table is parsed once per hour, i.e., asynchronously.

## Microformat Parsing
Source URLs of which the markup contains so-called [microformats](http://microformats.org/)—those generated by Bridgy, most blog posts—undergo some additional, rudimentary parsing.

## New in Version 0.5: Outgoing Webmentions
Whenever a new post is published, attempts to notify URLs mentioned in the post's body, using the [Webmention Client](https://github.com/indieweb/mention-client-php) for PHP.
