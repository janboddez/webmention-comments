# Webmention Comments
Basic Webmention support for WordPress.

Turns incoming webmentions into comments. All webmentions undergo basic validation and are then dumped into a database table. The content of that table is processed once per hour, i.e., asynchronously. No more than 5 webmentions are dealt with at once, in order to minimally burden the server WordPress is running on.

## Microformat Parsing
Source URLs of which the markup contains so-called [microformats](http://microformats.org/)—those generated by Bridgy, most blog posts—undergo some additional, rudimentary parsing.

## Outgoing Webmentions
Since version 0.5, whenever a post is published, or a previously published post updated, this plugin will attempt to notify URLs mentioned in the post's body, using the [Webmention Client](https://github.com/indieweb/mention-client-php) for PHP. This behavior, however, is easily disabled by adding `define('OUTGOING_WEBMENTIONS', false);` to your `wp-config.php` (and may soon move to a standalone plugin).
